My name is Funmilayo, a data analyst with a strong interest in healthcare analytics.
I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights and solve problems, but my curiosity extends beyond healthcare! 
This repository showcases a variety of projects I've worked on, utilizing Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools to explore datasets and bring them to life.
Feel free to browse around and see what piques your interest!
I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects, regardless of the domain.
So, if you have data you'd like to explore or need a helping hand with analysis, don't hesitate to reach out to me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/funmilayo-adeniyi/)
